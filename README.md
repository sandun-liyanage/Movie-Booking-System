# Movie Booking System
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Movie Reservation and Management System developed using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and WebSocket. The system enables seamless ticket booking and real-time seat availability updates on multiple devices, providing an efficient and user-friendly movie reservation experience.

Features
Ticket Booking: Users can browse available movies, select showtimes, and reserve seats for their preferred movie screenings. The system ensures a smooth ticket booking process, allowing users to choose their desired seats and proceed with the reservation.

Real-time Seat Availability Updates: The system utilizes WebSocket to provide real-time updates on seat availability. Users can see the latest seat status on multiple devices simultaneously, ensuring accurate information and avoiding conflicts or double bookings.

User Authentication: The application includes user authentication mechanisms, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their reservations. This ensures data security and personalization of the reservation experience.

Seat Selection and Customization: Users can select their preferred seats from an interactive seating layout. The system provides a visually appealing interface with seat customization options such as selecting different seat types (standard, VIP, etc.) or choosing specific seating areas.

Reservation Management: The system allows users to view and manage their reservations. Users can modify their reservation details, such as changing the movie, showtime, or seat selection, as long as the desired seats are available.

Testing Automation: The repository includes automated tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the movie reservation system. These tests cover critical functionalities such as ticket booking, seat availability updates, and reservation management, providing confidence in the system's performance.

Technologies Used
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web applications.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing movie, user, and reservation data.
WebSocket: A communication protocol enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and multiple clients.
